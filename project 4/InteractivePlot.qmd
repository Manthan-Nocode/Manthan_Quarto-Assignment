## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
source("main.r")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
install.packages("plotly")
```

```{r}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data = combined_data, x = ~GDP_per_capita, y = ~Child_Deprivation, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',
        marker = list(size = 10, color = 'rgba(255, 182, 193, .9)', line = list(color = 'rgba(152, 0, 0, .8)', width = 2)),
        text = ~paste("Country:", Country)) %>%
  layout(title = "Interactive Scatter Plot of GDP vs Child Deprivation")
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
