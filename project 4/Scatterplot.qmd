## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
source("main.r")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
scatter_plot <- ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = GDP_per_capita, y = Child_Deprivation)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Country)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Child Deprivation vs. GDP per Capita (2017)", x = "GDP Per Capita", y = "Deprivation %")

ggplotly(scatter_plot)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
